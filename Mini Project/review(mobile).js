        review:"The Galaxy S22 is a decent phone overall, with the limited battery life being the only major flaw in an otherwise excellent yet petite package.The design of this relatively small smartphone is suave yet understated, and the screen is strong and punchy  even if it isnt as huge as its rivals."

        review:"The iPhone 14 is the best iPhone for most people, but despite that, its not that exciting. The iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone 14 Pro Max get the biggest upgrades this year, a clever replacement for the notch and a 48MP main camera.Still, Action mode is another plus if youre looking for super smooth video. Plus Apple may be offering easier access to repairs for this generation, giving the iPhone 14 a surprise advantage over the iPhone 13."

        review:"the iPhone 14 Pro Max doesnot look like a major upgrade. And for those who own one of last years Pro models, it really doesnot make for a worthy buy. But for others, the iPhone 14 Pro Max brings quite a bit to the table. At a starting cost of Rs 1,39,900, it is pricey, sure, but for your money, you will get a daily driver thatâ€™s able to deliver a top-notch user experience that check marks almost all aspects of smartphone usage. the 14 Pro Max shouldnot leave you wanting for more. while the smaller model is definitely the handier of the two."

Had it offered the latest software and better camera hardware, the Realme 10 would have been the device to beat in the segment. However, the phone delivers in aspects like offering stable performance, a vivid display, long battery life, and a lightweight, attractive design. The Realme smartphone also packs the fan-favourite audio jack, NFC, and a dedicated slot for a microSD card. "

        review:"The Moto G40 Fusion is Lenovo-owned Motorolas latest G series smartphone launched alongside the Moto G60 (review). Aiming to disrupt the affordable segment and compete against brands like Xiaomi and Realme, the G40 Fusion has been priced starting at Rs 13,999. The phone boasts some decent features and respectable specs, including the Qualcomm Snapdragon 732G chipset, a 6,000mAh battery and a 120Hz refresh rate display. Lets see if the Moto G40 Fusion can go head to head against its rivals."

        review:"The Realme GT Neo 3's 150W fast charging system does make the phone worryingly hot and the display's 120Hz refresh rate isn't usable in most games that I tried. The SoC also falls a bit short in terms of raw performance compared to the competition, most of which pack a Qualcomm Snapdragon 888 SoC. Meanwhile, the phone also lacks a few hardware features like an IP rating or wireless charging, which are available on competing devices such as the Samsung Galaxy S20 FE 5G (Review) and the Apple iPhone (2022) (Review) in the similar priced range."
